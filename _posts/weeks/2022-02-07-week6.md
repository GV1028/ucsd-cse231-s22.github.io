## Lab Tasks

**Most of these instructions are Mac/Linux only; run on ieng6 if you have a
windows machine.**

As usual, this will be in some flux until the lab time on Wednesday, but you can
use it to look ahead and think about what you'll need to do.

The lab report task will be posted Monday evening and will be firm once posted,
so you can get started on it before Wednesday!

### Setup

Have a member of your group clone a fresh copy of `markdown-parse` that reflects
the work you've done so far as a group. Once they have the fresh copy and have
opened it in VScode:

- Start a timer
- Have them run the tests
- Have them run `MarkdownParse` from the command-line with `test-file.md` as input
- Stop the timer

How long did it take to do this? Where did they look up the necessary commands?
Did they make any typos or small mistakes? Were the commands in their command
history?

### Makefile

Create a `makefile` for your fork of `markdown-parse`. Your `makefile` should have a
target, `test`, that:

- Rebuilds the `.class` files using `javac` if the corresponding `.java` file
has updated
- Runs the tests after rebuilding the necessary `.class` files

Create any other targets you need for this; refer to the notes from class on
Monday to help.

**Write in notes**: Show what the makefile does for `make test`:

- When you have _no_ `.class` files in the directory (delete them if necessary)
- When you have both of the `.class` files present, then make a change to
`MarkdownParse.java`, save, and run. How many commands run, and why? Justify why
each is necessary.
- When you have both of the `.class` files present, then make a change to
`MarkdownParseTest.java`, save, and run. How many commands run, and why? Justify
why each is necessary.

**Write down in notes**: Add the makefile in a commit, push it, and note a link
to the commit in your notes.

**Write down in notes**: Then, change the Github Action on your repository to
just use `make test` instead of running multiple commands. Take a screenshot of
the action succeeding while using `make test` and link to the action's output.

### Bash Scripting

Create a file called `mdparse` in the current directory.

In it, add this text:

```
java -cp lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:. MarkdownParse $1
```

Then, from the command line, run:

```
bash mdparse test-file.md
```

then run

```
bash mdparse test-file2.md
```

**Write down in notes**: What does the `$1` mean? If you're struggling to define
this, add the line `echo $1` to `mdparse` and re-run it. What do you see?

A project will often define one or more scripts for command-line programs to
avoid having to type out, or deal with, a long classpath or other configuration.

Note that this is _distinct_ from the `makefile` for a good reason – it's not
nearly so easy to pass a command-line argument to a `makefile`, and they are
indeed not built for that purpose.

**Write down in notes:** Commit and push `mdparse` to the repository, and note
*the commit link in your notes document so everyone can find it later.

### Improvement

Have a member of your group clone a fresh copy of `markdown-parse` that reflects
the work you've done so far as a group and includes the `makefile` and
`mdparse`. Once they have the fresh copy and have opened it in VScode:

- Start a timer
- Have them run the tests
- Have them run `MarkdownParse` from the command-line with `test-file.md` as input
- Stop the timer

How long did it take to do this? Where did they look up the necessary commands?
Did they make any typos or small mistakes? Were the commands in their command
history?

### What an Autograder Does

Autograders are often built out of a combination of test files, makefiles, and
(bash) scripts.

Imagine that `markdown-parse` was a class assignment, and you were the TA
designing an automatic grader for it. One design choice you could make is to
create a test file `OfficialGradingTests.java` and an associated bash script
`grade.sh`. The `.java` file would have your tests in it, and the `.sh` file
would somehow get the student's code and run your tests on that code.

Design this grader as a team. We're not assuming you'll “finish” during the lab
time, so **write in notes** your plan. A good plan would lay out likely
commands/steps that you'd need to take as part of the bash script.

Assume

- The bash script gets the URL of the student's markdown-parse repository as its
first argument, and the bash script should download/clone the student code
- Students' code is laid out like in `markdown-parse`

Think about:

- What gets printed out for the student? What if there is a compile error? What
about a failed test?
- Did you rely on the `makefile` in the student directory? Should you?
- Where can you make the error messages better?
- What kind of output might the student expect?

Remember: You can use all the commands you're familiar with, like `cd`, `git`,
`make`, `cp`, and so on, in bash scripts. You might need to copy your `.java`
test file or the student code somewhere!

Remember to **write down in notes** your discussion and plan as a sketch of a
bash script. Also discuss if this made you learn anything about how autograders
might be running on your code in classes like CSE 8B, 11, and 12!
