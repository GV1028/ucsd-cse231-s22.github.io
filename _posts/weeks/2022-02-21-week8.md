## Lab Tasks

_Coming soon!_

## Week 8 Lab Report

Consider the following three markdown snippets:

### Snippet 1

```
`[a link`](url.com)

[another link](`google.com)`

[`cod[e`](google.com)

[`code]`](ucsd.edu)
```

### Snippet 2

```
[a [nested link](a.com)](b.com)

[a nested parenthesized url](a.com(()))

[some escaped \[ brackets \]](example.com)
```

### Snippet 3

```
[this title text is really long and takes up more than 
one line

and has some line breaks](

)

[this title text is really long and takes up more than 
one line](
    https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/
)


[this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis](github.com

And there's still some more text after that.

[this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis for a while](https://cse.ucsd.edu/



)

And then there's more text
```

For **each** snippet, add a test both to **your** implementation of
markdown-parse, _and_ the implementation you reviewed. Run the tests and show
the results of running the tests on each. This means you should add a total of
**6** test methods (3 to your implementation and 3 to the one you reviewed).

This means you will need to clone and run both your implementation and the one
you reviewed, make some small edits, and run them both.

Your report should include:

- A link to your markdown-parse repository and a link to the one you reviewed
- For each test above:
    - Decide on what it _should_ produce by using either VScode preview or [the CommonMark demo site](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/)
    - Showing the code in `MarkdownParseTest.java` for how you turned it into a test
    - For **your implementation**, the corresponding output when running the
    tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn't pass, show the specific part of
    the JUnit output that shows the test failure.
    - For **the implementation you reviewed**, the corresponding output when running the
    tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn't pass, show the specific part of
    the JUnit output that shows the test failure.
- Answer the following questions with 2-3 sentences each:
    - Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your
    program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with
    backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would
    be a more involved change.
    - Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your
    program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses,
    brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not,
    describe why it would be a more involved change.
    - Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your
    program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in
    brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe
    why it would be a more involved change.


If you're using a direct clone to `ieng6`, you might find it useful to give an
extra argument to `git clone` that specifies which directory to clone into, for
example:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse markdown-parse-target-directory
```

Add your lab report as `lab-report-4-week-8` within the same Github pages lab
reports repository you've been using all quarter, and include all of the
elements above.
