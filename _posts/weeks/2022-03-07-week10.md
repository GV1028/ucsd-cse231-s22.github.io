## Lab Tasks

**As usual, this may update somewhat before the actual lab time on Wednesday,
but it's a good overview and what we do will be close. You can get started on
the lab report immediately, it won't change aside from clarifications.**

### Not Writing Parsers

We've spent significant time working on `markdown-parse` this quarter. While
some might say too much, the instructor would say we've just scratched the
surface. Even a problem with a simple specification like this can still be much
more complex than we can reasonably implement in 10 weeks (are you convinced
that you're “done”?).

Parsers are a particularly tricky kind of software to get right. To get them
truly right, we have to fully understand _all_ possible inputs, even some that
might seem irrelevant for our task. We saw that with the interaction of, e.g.
`[nested[] brackets[][[]]](links)`, where we had to write entirely new loop
structures to manage some of these cases; this doesn't even get into extra
backticks and other formatting interfering with links.

One thing that I **highly** recommend in your career is not writing parsers
unless absolutely necessary. Most well-known markup languages, programming
languages, and input formats have perfectly useful open-source, free parsers
available. We've even seen one -- CommonMark!

While in principle it seems like CommonMark has done our job for us, it's worth
seeing what it looks like to actually _use_ it to accomplish something.
CommonMark has written a full parser and translator that turns `.md` files into
`.html` files. This isn't exactly what `getLinks` does. How to get from one to
the other?

#### Getting CommonMark

Well, the first thing to do is figure out how to run CommonMark at all. Here's
their Java implementation:

[https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java)

Before we run off and _clone_ it, let's think a little bit about our goals. We
don't (necessarily) want to edit the source code of CommonMark. It would be nice
if we could use it as a library. CommonMark, like JUnit (the other code we've
often used as a library), is distributed as `.jar` files. The README, which you
can see on their Github webpage, talks about this:

![](/images/commonmark-readme.png)

We've copied that [Maven
Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.commonmark) link here for your
convenience. Maven is a tool that's used for tracking, downloading, and updating
`.jar` files associated with Java libraries. We _could_ use to build/import
CommonMark, but we won't take the time for its complexity today. Instead, we'll
just download the correct `.jar` file directly.

There is a download link next to the top item in the list on Maven; download the
`.jar` file for it:

![](/images/maven-jar.png)

The file you've just downloaded is a lot like the `.jar` file we've used for
JUnit in its format -- we'll need to use `-cp` to include it when building and
running our program if we use its classes, for instance.

Put the `.jar` file you downloaded in the `lib/` directory of your
`markdown-parse` project.

#### Running an Example

Let's make a brand-new file to test out CommonMark and see if we can figure out
what it does. Let's copy one of their examples and try it out. Copy the first
example (Parse and Render HTML) from the CommonMark README into a new file
called `TryCommonMark.java`, then compile and run it.

Oops. I got something like this:

```
$ javac TryCommonMark.java 
TryCommonMark.java:5: error: class, interface, enum, or record expected
Parser parser = Parser.builder().build();
^
TryCommonMark.java:6: error: class, interface, enum, or record expected
Node document = parser.parse("This is *Sparta*");
^
TryCommonMark.java:7: error: class, interface, enum, or record expected
HtmlRenderer renderer = HtmlRenderer.builder().build();
^
TryCommonMark.java:8: error: class, interface, enum, or record expected
renderer.render(document);  // "<p>This is <em>Sparta</em></p>\n"
^
4 errors
```

**Write in notes**: Make sure you've copied the code and produced this error.

Turns out the CommonMark folks didn't give us a full working program with a
`main` method, and so on. They expected us to use our _general knowledge of how
Java works_ to take their example and produce a meaningful program out of it.
OK, we know how to make a `main` method. Let's leave the imports at the top, but
take the meaningful code and put it in `main`, like this:

```
import org.commonmark.node.*;
import org.commonmark.parser.Parser;
import org.commonmark.renderer.html.HtmlRenderer;

class TryCommonMark {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parser parser = Parser.builder().build();
        Node document = parser.parse("This is *Sparta*");
        HtmlRenderer renderer = HtmlRenderer.builder().build();
        renderer.render(document);  // "<p>This is <em>Sparta</em></p>\n"
    }
}
```

If we run _this_ version, we get another error:

```
$ javac TryCommonMark.java
TryCommonMark.java:2: error: package org.commonmark.parser does not exist
import org.commonmark.parser.Parser;
                            ^
TryCommonMark.java:3: error: package org.commonmark.renderer.html does not exist
import org.commonmark.renderer.html.HtmlRenderer;
                                   ^
TryCommonMark.java:1: error: package org.commonmark.node does not exist
import org.commonmark.node.*;
```

Of course! We need to include the classpath in order to access all that
CommonMark goodness. We could type this out at the command line, but we have a
pretty good place to put the classpath (and we know we'll need it there later) –
our `makefile`!

One thing that can make our lives a little easier here – classpath supports `*`
for use as a wildcard. So we can actually set our `CLASSPATH` variable to just
`lib/*:.`, and that will include _all_ the `.jar` files in `lib/` (along with
the current directory `.`) when we use `CLASSPATH` in the `makefile`:

```
CLASSPATH = lib/*:.
```

Then we can use a rule like `MarkdownParse.class` to built this class:

```
TryCommonMark.class: TryCommonMark.java
	javac -g -cp $(CLASSPATH) TryCommonMark.java
```

(Remember to make sure there's a `<tab>` character before the command)

Then we can run:

```
$ make TryCommonMark.class
javac -g -cp lib/*:. TryCommonMark.java
```

Cool! It built. If you get an error here, carefully check for typos and
completion of the last few steps. Brainstorm together what the cause could be!
Retrace the steps, use the error message, and so on to figure out how to make
this compile.

Then, let's try running it:

```
$ java TryCommonMark
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/commonmark/parser/Parser
        at TryCommonMark.main(TryCommonMark.java:7)
```

Oops! We need the `-cp` option to include the CommonMark jar file again. We can
use the abbreviated `*` version to save some typing:

```
$ java -cp "lib/*:." TryCommonMark
```

And it... sucessfully prints nothing!  Why doesn't it print anything? How can we
make it print something? Change the program so it actually prints the results.

**Write in notes**: Take a screenshot of your program printing the results. Make
a commit with the code so far – don't forget to add new files! Push, and put a
link to the commit in your notes document.

**Write in notes**: What's something that was confusing for your group about the
example CommonMark provided? What did they assume about you as a user? Do you
think other projects with READMEs that you'll encounter in the future make
similar assumptions?

#### Using CommonMark for Our Task

Printing HTML is great! But it doesn't accomplish our goal of implementing
`getLinks`. We need to review some of the other examples in the README to figure
out how to use this correctly.

**Before reading ahead**: which example from the
CommonMark README do you think is most helpful here, and why?

<p style="margin-bottom:10em;"></p>

This example seems promising:

[Use a visitor to process parsed nodes](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java#use-a-visitor-to-process-parsed-nodes)

Rather than rendering directly to HTML, it shows how to “visit” every `Text`
element in the parsed markdown. It counts words. We might be interested in doing
something similar to collect a list of all links!

First, let's make sure we can get the example working with our small demo file.
Again, it has two parts, the class that implements the visitor and the code that
goes in `main` or some other method that gets the evaluation started:

```
# this part actually does the computation
Node node = parser.parse("Example\n=======\n\nSome more text");
WordCountVisitor visitor = new WordCountVisitor();
node.accept(visitor);
visitor.wordCount;  // 4

# this class can be defined anywhere in the file
class WordCountVisitor extends AbstractVisitor {
    int wordCount = 0;

    @Override
    public void visit(Text text) {
        // This is called for all Text nodes. Override other visit methods for other node types.

        // Count words (this is just an example, don't actually do it this way for various reasons).
        wordCount += text.getLiteral().split("\\W+").length;

        // Descend into children (could be omitted in this case because Text nodes don't have children).
        visitChildren(text);
    }
}
```

Add these parts to `TryCommonMark.java` and add a print statement to print the
resulting word count – make sure you can get this kind of interaction:

```
$ make TryCommonMark.class
javac -g -cp lib/*:. TryCommonMark.java
$ java -cp "lib/*:." TryCommonMark
4
```

**Write down in notes** once you get this behavior, make a commit and push, and
copy the link to the commit into your notes document.

There's a bit of jargon here that's common to parsing tools. The parsed markdown
string is returned as a `Node` -- so, a tree. A _Visitor_ is a programming
pattern for trees where a visitor class can override a `visit` method with
arguments of different types corresponding to types of nodes in the tree. Here,
that's `Text`, so the `visit(Text)` method gets called for each text node in the
tree.

There's another node type called `Link` (I looked it up in the [documentation
linked from the
README](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.commonmark/commonmark/latest/index.html)).

With this in mind, there are a few steps left to get a full `getLinks`
implementation:

- Try writing another _visitor_ (a class that extends `AbstractVisitor`) whose
`visit` method takes `Link` arguments, and whose overall purpose is to count the
links in a file rather than the number of words. Change the example you have in
`TryCommonMark.java` to use this visitor instead (and make sure it has a link in
it!).
- Change the visitor so that instead of counting the number of links, it adds
each link to an `ArrayList<String>`. Test it out using `TryCommonMark`.
- Move your visitor implementation over into `MarkdownParse.java`. Delete the
body of `getLinks(String)` (don't worry, it's saved in `git`), and replace it with code
to use the visitor to get the links and return them. Remember to move over any
necessary `import` statements!
- Run your tests! Do they all pass? Try running it on all the `test-files/` from
last week's lab, and on other, more complex/larger tests.

**Write down in notes**: How far did you get? Copy the commit with the last
checkpoint where you had things running along this progression into your notes.

The main lesson here is that if you find yourself needing to write something
like a parser for a project, _you probably don't have to do it yourself_. You
will likely be better off reading some documentation and using an
already-existing tool.

Of course, using existing tools often requires reading documentation,
understanding logistics like how to find and import a `.jar` file, adapting
examples for your own use, and so on. These are skills you can practice, ask for
help with, and so on in order to broaden the kinds of programs you can write.

### Review Game

Having fun is a good way to make memories, including about computing content.
For the next 30 minutes of lab, we'll play a game together reviewing content
from CSE15L. Your lab tutor will wrap up the last part with about an hour left
to move on to the game, which will be done with the whole lab section (not just
your group).

### AMA with the Staff

For the last 30 minutes of lab, you'll have the chance to ask anything
(reasonable) to your lab staff (TA and all the tutors for your section). You'll
get a section-specific Google Form for submitting questions, and you'll also be
able to raise your hand and ask questions live. Ask about CS courses,
internships, tutoring, research, folks' experience at UCSD in general and in
CSE, and more!

## Lab Report 5

In lab 9, you experimented with the many tests provided from commonmark-spec.
For this lab report, choose any _two_ tests where your implementation (or a
representative implementation from your group) had _different_ answers than the
implementation we provided for lab 9. Note that this is the implementation in
the [markdown-parse](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse)
repository, _not_ the one you did today in lab 10. The tests with different
answers should correspond to **different bugs** – that is, you couldn't easily
fix both with one code change.

Explain:

- How you found the tests with different results (Did you use `diff` on the
results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use
some other programmatic idea?)
- For each test:
    - Describe which implementation is correct, or if you think _neither_ is
    correct, by showing both actual outputs and indicating what the expected
    output is.
    - For the implementation that's not correct (or choose one if both are
    incorrect), describe the _bug (the problem in the code). You don't have to
    provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the
    program, and show the code that should be fixed.

You can submit your lab report to the “Lab Repor 5” assignment on Gradescope as
usual with links to your report page and repository. Make your lab report as a
separate page on your Github pages site linked from the index as in past
reports.
