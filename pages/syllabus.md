## Course Components {#components}

There are several components to the course:

- **Lectures**
- **Quizzes**
- **Assignments** (first half of the course)
- **Projects** (second half of the course)

### Lectures

The course has lecture each Tuesday and Thursday in Center 214, 20 total. Some
attendance and participation is required – you have to come to 8 lectures
in-person, and participate, to pass the course. There are a few reasons for this
policy and this particular number:

1. Without _any_ incentive, it's too easy to decide that attending isn't worth
the effort of commuting, putting on pants, etc, and that you can learn just as
well by watching the podcast after the fact or participating remotely. I don't
believe this is uniformly true, and I want people to at least get exposed to the
value of being part of an in-person community.

2. Lectures will be designed for you to engage and discuss with your classmates
via [peer instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_instruction) and other
active learning methods. Research shows convincing evidence that these are
effective ways to learn!

3. I don't want you or us to have to do complex logistics around you being sick,
traveling for a conference or interview, etc. Also, being physically present is
an investment of time, and a lot of us are living somewhat hybrid lives still.
It will take some time to adjust back to in-person activities. I want to respect
that, and I also want to respect the choices of students who feel they learn
best remotely.

    As a result, I settled on 8 and I am **firm** on this requirement. This is
    the only policy for extenuating circumstances, travel, sickness, etc.
    Please plan to attend more than 8 so that you give yourself a fair amount of
    slack, and front-load your attendance as much as possible to avoid later
    surprises. You might even find that you like coming to class!

Mechanically, this means that you'll need an iClicker to click into live quiz
questions that happen during class, which is how we'll gauge participation. You
don't have to get the questions right! There will be app options that you can
use on a mobile device instead of purchasing a clicker, but these are subject to
WiFi connectivity and not always supported. We highly recommend that you get an
iClicker at the UCSD Bookstore to bring to class.

Each lecture will also be streamed over Zoom and recorded. There will be course
staff both in the room physically and on a live chat to answer questions and
facilitate discussions during lecture. Attending on Zoom **does not** count
towards 8 required attendances.

## Weekly Quizzes

Each week (after the first) there will be a _lecture quiz_ that reviews the
content from the previous week. These will be due on _Monday evening_. They will
be administered on Gradescope. You can submit as many times as you like and will
get immediate feedback on the correctness of your answers.

They will reference the readings given each week, as well as content from
lectures. They may involve downloading and running code to get expected output
from a program or other nontrivial tasks, so leave some time for them.

## Assignments

For the first 4-5 weeks of the course, we will have a weekly _programming
assignment_. These will involve you writing a compiler according to some
specification that we provide, and submitting on Gradescope. You'll get a mix of
automated and manual feedback from us. For some assignments we may also do _peer
review_, where your classmates give feedback on your work (and you give feedback
to them).

## Projects

For the last 5-6 weeks of the course, you'll work on _projects_.
